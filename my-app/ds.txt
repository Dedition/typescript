An object is an unordered collection of properties.
Each property has a name and a value.
 A property’s value can be a primitive value, object, function, or even another array.

 The datatypes in JavaScript are:

 String - a sequence of characters used to represent text

 Number - integer or floating point

 Boolean - true or false

 Object - Arrays, Dates, Math, Regular Expressions, Functions, Objects, Errors. All are objects.

 Null - a special type of object. It has a single value: null

 Undefined - A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.

 BigInt - new in ES2020 and is used to represent integers with arbitrary precision.

 Symbol - new in ES6 and is used to create unique identifiers for objects.

An array is a special kind of object. More specifically, it's a contiguous collection of properties.
What this means is that the properties of an array are numbered sequentially, starting with 0.


 The way React works is that it takes a bunch of data and renders it into a view.
 React mostly works on the virtual DOM, which is a representation of the real DOM.
The virtual DOM is a JavaScript object that is a representation of the real DOM. It is a lightweight representation of the real DOM.
The benefit of using the virtual DOM is that it is much faster to update than the real DOM. Another benefit is that it is easier to work with than the real DOM.
The best reason to use React is that it is a declarative library.
It is declarative because it allows you to describe what you want to see on the screen, and React will take care of updating the DOM to match that description.
React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
React 16.8 came out in February 2019. It was the first release to include Hooks.
The reason they are called hooks is that they “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.
The reason they are so useful is that they allow you to reuse stateful logic between components.

    What this means is that Python is easier to read and write, while JavaScript is more difficult to read and write.

 Python is a general-purpose language, while JavaScript is a scripting language.
    What this means is that Python can be used for many different things, while JavaScript is mainly used for web development.

 Python is a dynamically typed language, while JavaScript is a statically typed language.
    What this means is that Python does not require you to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, while JavaScript does.

 Python is a case-sensitive language, while JavaScript is a case-insensitive language.
    What this means is that Python is case-sensitive, while JavaScript is not.

 Python is a whitespace-sensitive language, while JavaScript is a whitespace-insensitive language.
    What this means is that Python is whitespace-sensitive, while JavaScript is not.

 Python is a multi-paradigm language, while JavaScript is a single-paradigm language.
    What this means is that Python supports multiple programming paradigms, while JavaScript only supports the object-oriented programming paradigm.
